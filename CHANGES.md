# Supertrend replaced by Volumatic VIDYA + MA Cross (9/21/50/200)

- `lib/indicators.ts`: `supertrend()` removed. New `vidya()` (CMO-adaptive VIDYA 10/20, SMA-15 smoothing, ATR(200) x 2 flip bands, buy/sell volume + delta % per trend leg) and `maCross()` (EMA 9/21/50/200, state + candles-since-cross for 9/21, 21/50, 50/200).
- `lib/signals.ts`: bucket vote = VIDYA direction + at least 2 of 3 confirmations (RSI, MACD, MA cross alignment; `MIN_CONFIRMATIONS`). Score budget stays 100: VIDYA maturity 10 + MA cross alignment 5 (was Supertrend maturity 15).
- Types/UI: `supertrend` field replaced by `vidya` and `maCross` on CoinSignal/BtcTrend; sidebar shows VIDYA, MA Cross and VIDYA volume delta; coin header shows VIDYA and MA Cross chips.
- The 1H confluence gate (EMA200, EMA stack, SMA50/200, MACD, Ribbon) is unchanged.

# What was actually wrong, and what changed

## Root causes found
1. **Not using Binance at all.** `/api/market` was pulling from CoinGecko (spot market, top 100 by market cap), not Binance Futures.
2. **No real Supertrend.** The "Supertrend" was actually EMA+RSI+slope voting on fake mini price windows — never an ATR-based Supertrend. That's why it looked frozen: it wasn't a real indicator to begin with.
3. **Fake timeframes.** CoinGecko only gives 7-day hourly data, but the code sliced it into tiny windows and labeled them "1M/3M/5M" as if they were 1-minute candles. Completely mislabeled.
4. **Silent fake data fallback.** If CoinGecko failed or rate-limited, the app quietly generated randomized synthetic prices and displayed them as if real (`live:false` flag existed but wasn't obvious in the UI).
5. **Broken repo structure** (in the *other* repo you first sent me) — files were flat when imports expected `app/`, `lib/`, `components/` folders. That repo would fail to build from a fresh clone.
6. **No trade-freeze / auto SL-TP.** This specific repo (`new-project-my`) didn't have the auto-close-on-SL/TP feature yet — I ported it over from your other repo, where it did already work correctly.

## What's fixed now
- **Real Binance USDT-M Futures data**: `lib/binance.ts` pulls the full list of live PERPETUAL/USDT contracts (250-300+, exceeds your "100+" ask) plus real 1H candles.
- **Real ATR-based Supertrend**: `lib/indicators.ts` implements the actual algorithm (period 10, multiplier 3) with proper band-flip logic — verified with a runtime test that it correctly flips direction when price action actually reverses.
- **Honest timeframes**: relabeled to `4H / 12H / 1D / 2D`, built by resampling real 1H candles (not fake slices).
- **No more fake data**: if Binance is unreachable, the UI now says so explicitly ("DATA UNAVAILABLE") instead of quietly showing synthetic numbers.
- **Trade freeze + live PnL**: entry/stop/target lock the moment you log a trade; only price and P&L update live every 15s (unchanged behavior, now fed by real Binance prices).
- **Rate-limit safe**: signal/Supertrend recompute is cached for 3 minutes (klines are heavy); price ticks refresh every 15s via one cheap bulk endpoint.
- **PWA / mobile install**: added `manifest.json`, a minimal service worker, and app icons so you can "Add to Home Screen" on iOS/Android and it opens like a native app.

## Honest limitation
"Accurate signals only" isn't something any system can promise — I tightened the confluence logic (Supertrend + RSI + MACD must agree, and 3-of-4 timeframes must align) so it should throw fewer, higher-quality signals, but losses will still happen. Treat the score as a filter, not a guarantee.
